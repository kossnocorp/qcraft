# Superstate

A JavaScript statecharts library that is:

- End-to-end type-safe
- Easy to read without visualization
- Highly composable
- Lightweight and fast

Take a look:

```ts
import { superstate } from "superstate";

type PlayerState = "stopped" | "playing" | "paused";

const playerState = superstate<PlayerState>("player")
  .state("stopped", "play() -> playing")
  .state("playing", ["pause() -> paused", "stop() -> stopped"], ($) =>
    $.sub("volume", volumeState)
  )
  .state("paused", ["play() -> playing", "stop() -> stopped"]);

type VolumeState = "low" | "medium" | "high";

const volumeState = superstate<VolumeState>("volume")
  .state("low", "up() -> medium")
  .state("medium", ["up() -> high", "down() -> low"])
  .state("high", "down() -> medium");
```

Even without rendering a chart, it is easy to see the logic.

## Installation

Start by installing the package:

```sh
npm i superstate
```

## Getting started

Superstate is an implementation of the statecharts formalism [introduced by David Harel in 1987](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0167642387900359). It adds hierarchy to state machines, making it possible to express complex logic without losing readability.

To get started, you only need to understand a few concepts:

- **State**: The available system states. Only a single state can be active at a time (e.g. `stopped` or `playing`). A state might have _substates_.
- **Event**: What triggers _transitions_ between the system _states_ (e.g. `up()` or `play()`). You send _events_ to control the system.
- **Transition**: The process of moving from one _state_ to another. It's coupled with the triggering _event_ and the next _state_ (e.g. `up() -> medium`).
- **Action**: What happens during _transitions_, upon entering or exiting a _state_ (e.g. `playMusic!`). _Actions_ call your code.

Everything else is built on top of these concepts.

### Basics

The `superstate` function creates a new statechart. It accepts the name, available states as the generic type and returns the builder object:

```ts
const volumeState = superstate<VolumeState>("volume")
  .state("low", "up() -> medium")
  .state("medium", ["up() -> high", "down() -> low"])
  .state("high", "down() -> medium");
```

The first state, `low`, is the initial state that the statechart will enter when it starts. The `state` method accepts the name and list of state traitsâ€”in this caseâ€”transitions.

The events that trigger state transitions are `up()` and `down()`. Events always have `()` at the end, which makes them easy to spot.

---

To use the machine, run the `host` method:

```ts
const volume = volumeState.host();

// Subscribe to the state changes:
volume.on(["low", "medium", "high"], (target) =>
  sound.setVolume(target.state.name)
);

// Trigger the events:
volume.send("up()");

// Check the current state:
if (volume.in("high")) console.log("The volume is at maximum");
```

The method creates an instance of statechart. It's the object that you will interact with, which holds the actual state.

Using the `on` method you can listen to everything `*`, a single state or an event, or a combination of them:

```ts
// Listen to everything:
volume.on("*", (target) => {
  if (target.type === "state") {
    console.log("State changed to", target.state.name);
  } else {
    console.log("Event triggered", target.event.name);
  }
});

// Will trigger when the state is `low` or when `down()` is sent:
volume.on(["low", "down()"], (target) => {
  if (target.type === "state") {
    console.log("The volume is low");
  } else {
    console.log("The volume is going down");
  }
});
```

### Guards

Transitions can be guarded, allowing to have conditional transitions:

```ts
type PCState = "on" | "sleep" | "off";

const pcState = superstate<PCState>("pc")
  .state("off", "press() -> on")
  .state("on", ($) =>
    $.if("press", ["(long) -> off", "() -> sleep"]).on("restart() -> on")
  )
  .state("sleep", ($) =>
    $.if("press", ["(long) -> off", "() -> on"]).on("restart() -> on")
  );
```

In this example, we used the `if` method to guard the transitions. The `press` event might trigger one of the two transitions: a long press and another for a short press (else).

There are several ways to define state traits, and passing a function as the last argument is one of them. It allows for defining more complex logic.

To send an event with a condition, use the `send` method:

```ts
const pc = pcState.host();

// Send the long press event:
const nextState = pc.send("press()", "long");

// The next state is "off":
if (nextState) nextState.name satisfies "off";
```

Unless it's not in the `off` state, the `press` event will transition the statechart to the `off` state.

If you send the `press()` event without the condition, it might transition to the `sleep` or the `on` state:

```ts
// Send the press event:
const nextState = pc.send("press()");

// The next state is "sleep":
if (nextState) nextState.name satisfies "sleep" | "on";
```

### Actions

Actions allow you define side effects that happen when entering or exiting a state or during a transition.

While you trigger the events, the actions trigger your code:

```ts
type ButtonState = "off" | "on";

const buttonState = superstate<ButtonState>("button")
  .state("off", ["-> turnOff!", "press() -> on"])
  .state("on", ["-> turnOn!", "press() -> off"]);
```

You can notice that the state definitions include strings with `!` at the end, i.e., `turnOn!` and `turnOff!`. These are the actions.

They define what happens when the state is entered and force you to handle the side effects in your code:

```ts
// Bind the actions to code:
const button = buttonState.host({
  on: {
    "-> turnOn!": () => console.log("Turning on"),
  },
  off: {
    "-> turnOff!": () => console.log("Turning on"),
  },
});
```

In addition to enter actions (`-> turnOff!`), states can have exit actions (`turnOff! ->`), which are invoked when the state is left:

```ts
// The on state invokes the enter and exit actions:
const buttonState = superstate<ButtonState>("button")
  .state("off", "press() -> on")
  .state("on", ["-> turnOn!", "press() -> off", "turnOff! ->"]);

const button = buttonState.host({
  on: {
    "-> turnOn!": () => console.log("Turning on"),
    "turnOff! ->": () => console.log("Turning off"),
  },
});
```

The transition actions (`press() -> turnOff! -> off`) are invoked during transitions:

```ts
// Actions are invoked on transitions:
const buttonState = superstate<ButtonState>("button")
  .state("off", "press() -> turnOn! -> on")
  .state("on", "press() -> turnOff! -> off");

const button = buttonState.host({
  on: {
    "press() -> turnOff!": () => console.log("Turning on"),
  },
  off: {
    "press() -> turnOn!": () => console.log("Turning off"),
  },
});
```

Like with most Superstate API, there are several ways to define actions, allowing you to choose the right one for the situation.

The events and actions can be defined in the builder function or even mixed with the string-based definitions:

```ts
// Use the builder function to define the states:
const buttonState = superstate<ButtonState>("button")
  .state("on", ($) => $.enter("turnOn!").on("press() -> off").exit("turnOff!"))
  .state("off", ($) => $.on("press() -> on"));
```

### Substates

Substates are states that are nested within a parent state. A state might have multiple substates, making it a parallel state, representing concurrent logic:

```ts
type PlayerState = "stopped" | "playing" | "paused";

const playerState = superstate<PlayerState>("player")
  .state("stopped", "play() -> playing")
  .state("playing", ["pause() -> paused", "stop() -> stopped"], ($) =>
    // Nest the volume state as `volume`
    $.sub("volume", volumeState)
  )
  .state("paused", ["play() -> playing", "stop() -> stopped"]);

type VolumeState = "low" | "medium" | "high";

const volumeState = superstate<VolumeState>("volume")
  .state("low", "up() -> medium")
  .state("medium", ["up() -> high", "down() -> low"])
  .state("high", "down() -> medium");
```

In this example, we nest the `volumeState` inside the `playing` state. The the `volumeState` will be initialized when the `playing` state is entered and will be destroyed when the `playing` state is exited.

You can send events, subscribe to changes, and access the substate from the parent state:

```ts
const player = playerState.host();

// Send events to the substate:
player.send("playing.volume.up()");

// Subscribe to the substate changes:
player.on("playing.volume.low", (target) => console.log("The volume is low"));

// The parent state will have the substate as a property on `sub`:
const playingState = player.in("playing");
if (playingState) {
  // Access the substate:
  playingState.sub.volume.in("high");
}
```

A state can be final, representing the end of the statechart:

```ts
type OSState = "running" | "sleeping" | "terminated";

const osState = superstate<OSState>("running")
  .state("running", "terminate() -> terminated")
  .state("sleeping", ["wake() -> running", "terminate() -> terminated"])
  // Mark the terminated state as final
  .final("terminated");
```

When nesting in such a state, the parent might connect the final states through an event to a parent state, allowing for a more complex logic:

```ts
type PCState = "on" | "off";

const pcState = superstate<PCState>("pc")
  .state("off", "power() -> on")
  .state("on", ($) =>
    $.on("power() -> off")
      // Nest the OS state as `os` and connect the `terminated` state
      // through `shutdown()` event to `off` state of the parent.
      .sub("os", osState, "terminated -> shutdown() -> off")
  );
```

When the OS is terminated, the PC will automatically power off.
